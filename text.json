    "announcement": "# The new `/info` command!\r\n\r\n**What is it?**\r\nMost/all of you have seen <@471096018843336717>'s very useful [staff help site](https://geko-3.github.io/MonopolyGoTrading.github.io/) that contains a number of generic staff messages that you can send to members to warn/remind them of things. I've seen how helpful this has been and I think it's amazing!\r\n\r\n<@654424367660269570> made a separate request to have the most common warnings added to `-prefix` commands that would let you send those messages directly from server. I took this one step further, as you know I love to improve <@1176328980798906428>, and created the `/info` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I use it?**\r\nThis command will let you send messages from Geko's site directly in the server, anonymously through the <@1176328980798906428>. Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n1. Visit the [staff help site](https://geko-3.github.io/MonopolyGoTrading.github.io/) to learn the names of the commands you can use.\r\n2. In the chat you wish to send the message type: `/info get:`\r\n3. Within the `get` option, type the name of the message you wish to send, for example `/info get: spam`\r\n4. Send the message\r\n\r\nYou will then be shown `Cancel` and `Send Message` buttons. This gives you a chance to review the message before sending it, in case it's not what you wanted. You will also see which channel it is going to send in (if you haven't changed it - see below).\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to send the message, press the big green `Send Message` button and that message will be sent by the bot to the channel. If you decide not to send it, you can either press `Cancel` to remove it or leave it. After 60 seconds the buttons will be removed and the message will expire.\r\n\r\n**The command also lets you make a couple of changes too:**\r\n\r\n- You can add the `member:` option to @ the user. This will add the \"Hey <@227902035024936961>\" to the top of the message.\r\n- You can add the `channel:` option to send the message to a channel of your choice, if you want to send it to a channel other than where you've type the command.\r\n\r\n<@471096018843336717> and <@654424367660269570> have put a lot of work into rewriting the help site to make this command work, so please let them know their work is highly appreciated!",
